  abstract = "Tests of self-control theory have examined a substantial number
              of criminal behaviors, but no study has examined the correlation
              of low self-control with software piracy. Using data collected
              from 302 students in this university, this study examined the
              correlation of low self-control with software piracy and the
              moderating role of associating with deviant peers in this
              correlation. Low self-control correlated with software piracy
              more strongly for those who had high associations with deviant
              peers than for students with low associations with deviant peers.
              Analysis indicated differential links for lack of moral attitude
              in relation to software piracy and favorable attitudes for
              software piracy for varying association with deviant peers.",
