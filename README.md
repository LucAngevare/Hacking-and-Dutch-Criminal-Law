# Hacking and Dutch Criminal Law
This is a research paper I made for civics, it includes the possible punishments you may receive, the reasons for those punishments, under which laws, etc.

## Things I might change if I ever come back to this project

<sup>which I most definitely will never do because the hours that I put into this might have been some of the most boring hours *ever*</sup>

* Example cases
* Maximum punishments

I am still getting feedback on the paper so I might still change a few of these things along with other things including but not limited to the license, which is just about insane in it's current state.
